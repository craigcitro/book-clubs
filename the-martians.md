## The Manhattan Project, the Martians, and the Atomic Bomb

I've always been interested in the work of the folks on the Manhattan Project
-- probably first spurred by reading Feynman's books, but magnified by this
[biography of von Neumann by
Ulam](https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1958-64-03/S0002-9904-1958-10189-5/S0002-9904-1958-10189-5.pdf).
This led to a whole constellation of books:

* _Martians of Science_ by Hargittai talks about all the Martians, and is
  likely a good starting point.
* _The Making of the Atomic Bomb_ by Rhodes is usually considered a classic,
  and covers the Manhattan Project itself.
* _The Martian's Daughter: a Memoir_ by Whitman is by von Neumann's daughter.
* _John von Neumann and the Origins of Modern Computing_ by Aspray and Misa
  covers more about the period just after WWII.
* _American Prometheus_ by Bird and Sherwin won a Pulitzer, and tells the
  story of Oppenheimer.
* _Adventures of a Mathematician_ by Ulam is an autobiography.
* _The Man from the Future_ by Bhattacharya is a new von Neumann bio that
  might be interesting.

Straying a bit further afield, there are a handful of books that talk about
technology and near-misses, which always include nuclear bombs.

* _The End is Always Near_ by Carlin 
* _Command and Control_ by Schlosser wasn't great as an audiobook, but might
  do better in print.
* _The Ghost Map_ by Johnson tells the story of John Snow and cholera.

Books to (probably) avoid:
  
* _John von Neumann and Norbert Weiner_ by Heims is apparently a bit more of a
  polemic, intent on trying to defend Weiner and attack von Neumann.
