spurred by https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-new-link-to-an-old-model-could-crack-the-mystery-of-deep-learning-20211011/, i started grabbing some links.

* deep learning and kernel learning: https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01396
* gradient descent: https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02054

other:

* modern mathematics of deep learning: https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04026

## ML/Stats

* https://normaldeviate.wordpress.com/2012/12/21/guest-post-rob-tibshirani/ is
  a nice list of papers to work through.

* _Intro to Computational Learning Theory_, by Kearns and Vazirani. [cosma
  review](http://bactra.org/reviews/kearns-vazirani/)

* _Probably Approximately Correct_, by Valiant. Apparently this is an example
  of someone really coming up with the _right_ notion.

* _The Book of Why_ by Pearl & MacKenzie looks like a pop-science intro to
  causality, which is usually a red flag; my understanding is that they erred
  too far on the side of "has some heavier content". [Gelman's
  review](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/01/08/book-pearl-mackenzie/)
  is quite compelling, and there's more in [Lisa Goldberg's
  review](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201907/rnoti-p1093.pdf) that
  I'd like to re-digest once I've read this (esp. the references).
  
* _Computer Age Statistical Inference_ by Efron and Hastie is probably the
  data analysis overview I'd most like to read once I've actually learned a
  little more statistics.

* _A History of Data Visualization_ by Friendly and Wainer looks like a nice
  read ([MAA review](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/a-history-of-data-visualization-and-graphic-communication)).

* _Patterns, Predictions, and Actions_ by Hardt and Recht is
  [online](https://mlstory.org/index.html) and looks like it's worth a read.
