# Science, Progress, the Science of Progress, and the Progress of Science

## Some books

* _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_ by Kuhn: A classic, about which I didn't feel 
  compelled to [write much?](https://craigcitro.org/books#the-structure-of-scientific-revolutions-by-thomas-s-kuhn-4-5)

* _Sciences of the Artificial_, by Herbert Simon. I see this recommended all
  over, as one of the "everyone should read" books that I've never read.
  [Cosma's review](http://bactra.org/notebooks/simon.html) suggests the older
  editions might be less wordy.

* _Scientific Freedom_, by Donald Braben.

* _Laboratory Life_, by Latour and Woolgar.
