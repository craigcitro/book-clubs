what on earth?!

* [Cosma Shalizi's notebooks](http://bactra.org/notebooks/) are the OG. In
  fairness, the long lists of "to read" with no information about where the
  recs come from are less useful for my needs.

* [bollu.github.io](https://bollu.github.io/) is another variation, growing a
  long list and shuttling the more complete ones off into separate files.
