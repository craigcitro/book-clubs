## floating point

I've been reading a bit here and need to put some thoughts down; adding a few
links before I lose track of them:

* a light but entertaining [interview with William
  Kahan](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/ieee754status/754story.html)
  about the IEEE 754 process
  
* _Numerical Computing with IEEE Floating Point Arithmetic_ by Overton is
  fantastic. [site](https://cs.nyu.edu/~overton/book/index.html) [review by
  Higham](https://sinews.siam.org/Details-Page/book-review-revisited-overtons-numerical-computing-with-ieee-floating-point-arithmetic)
