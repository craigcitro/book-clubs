## Tech/Business/Finance

* _The Halo Effect_ by Rosenzweig -- I saw this get a hearty endorsement (but
  I've lost track of where).
  
* _The Goal_ by Goldratt is interesting but likely wordy; there's a graphic
  novel version that I suspect would be enjoyable-against-all-odds in the same
  way _The Phoenix Project_ was.

* _How Design Makes the World_ by Berkun was recommended somewhere as a
  more-compelling _Design of Everyday Things_, but I don't remember where.

Two upcoming books about Amazon:

* _Amazon Unbound_ by Stone is a followup to the (excellent) _Everything
  Store_.
* _Working Backwards_ by Bryor also looks good.

There's a collection of books about Wall Street (specifically leading up to
the 2008 crash):
  
* _All the Devils Are Here_ by McLean and Nocera
* _When Genius Failed_ by Lowenstein
* _Flash Boys_ by Lewis
* _Lying for Money_ by Davies

Personal finance:

* _Your Money or Your Life_ by Robin and Dominguez is maybe worth reading, if
  dated (as per [Eli Bendersky's
  review](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2019/summary-of-reading-january-march-2019/)).
  
Tech history:

* _Go To_ by Lohr
* _Dealers of Lightning_ by Hiltzik
* _The Dream Machine_ by Waldrop

## Historical

* _Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps_ by Galison gives a bit of history of
  relativity.

* _The Extended Phenotype_ by Dawkins has a solid [review by
  Cosma](http://bactra.org/reviews/extended-phenotype/).

## Learning and memory

* Matuschak and Nielsen's [How Can We Develop Transformative Tools for
  Thought?](https://numinous.productions/ttft/)
  
* _Make it Stick_ by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel.

    * Story time: the way Elman taught our grad algebra class was an
      interesting slice of ideas from _Make it Stick_. The system: he'd start
      by pulling out the previous iteration of his notes, and rereading it.
      Then he'd put it away, and rewrite it from scratch, iterating on it a
      bit. He'd do this a few times, over a period of days leading up to
      delivering the lecture, so that by the time he got into class, he didn't
      even need his notes -- he had everything fresh in his mind; he'd
      occasionally look back at his notes to make sure he didn't miss any
      content. He'd be interleaving this with the next section at any given
      time, meaning he also had a clear sense for what was coming up.
      
## Assorted nonfiction

* _Range_ by Epstein -- I started this and didn't love it, but will likely
  give it another spin given how many people have recommended it. (Most
  recently, the Bill Gates end of year 2020 list.)
* _The Philosophy Gym_ by Law was recommended by Sameer as an intro to
  philosophy, about which I know almost nothing.
* _Moneyball_ by Lewis
* _Endure_ by Hutchinson and Gladwell

## Modern society, Politics, Political Memoirs, ...

* _The View from Flyover Country_ by Kendzior
* _Digital Minimalism_ by Newport
* _Fentanyl, Inc_ by Westhoff -- I ran into this while listening to the
  author's interview on Conversations with Tyler; my takeaway was definitely
  "I'm interested to hear more of what this person has to say".
* _Why We're Polarized_ by Klein
* _Stubborn Attachments_ by Cowen
* _Calling Bullshit_ by Bergstrom and West
* _Unwarranted_ by Friedman
* _The Hype Machine_ by Aral
* _Teachers have it Easy_ by Moulthrop, Calegari, Eggers
* _Among the Thugs_ by Bill Buford, rec'd by [Paul
  Romer](https://twitter.com/paulmromer/status/1346923281639743498).

* _Very Important People_ by Mears (from CWT)
* _The Biggest Bluff_ by Konnikova. Another CWT guest, but I'd also heard
  about this book independently: apparently she got interested in writing a
  book on poker players, but ended up becoming a world-class player herself.

* _The Beastie Boys Book_, because who *doesn't* need a 600 page memoir about
  the Beastie Boys?

## Fiction

* _The Three-Body Problem_ by Liu
* _Parable of the Sower_ by Butler
* _Vast_ by Nagata
* The Broken Earth novels, by N. K. Jemisin.
  + Some of her short stories are also in podcast form:
    [one](https://escapepod.org/people/n-k-jemisin/)
    [two](https://podcastle.org/people/n-k-jemisin/)

### comics

* _Newuniversal_ by Warren Ellis -- this sounds like everything I love about
  comics: a reimagining, and focusing in part on how normal people interact
  with a world that has superheroes. And it's by Ellis to boot!

### scifi to reread

* Ken Macleod
* Alastair Reynolds
