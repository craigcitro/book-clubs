## Game theory

  is a list of books on auctions/algorithmic game theory that looks
  interesting.
  
* _Fixed Point Theorems_ by Border, originally from [an interview with Francis
  Su](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/francis-sus-favorite-theorem/).

* _The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior_, by von Neumann and Morgenstern.

### Combinatorial Game Theory

My undergrad game theory course ended up being mostly a course in
combinatorial game theory, to do with understanding results for existing
games, eg Checkers and Nine Men's Morris. I mostly read chunks of [_Games of
No Chance_](http://library.msri.org/books/Book29/contents.html) and a little
bit of _Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays_. The article about Marion
Tinsley made quite the impression at the time.

My overall takeaway is that I don't feel the intrinsic love for combinatorial
games that some folks do, but I don't know if that's just a matter of taste,
or if I don't have an appreciation for how useful they are in other contexts.

## Economics

I don't really know anything about economics, and I got ~nothing out of my
high school/college classes. I'd love to start with some basics, and I know
nothing about either micro or macro.

* _The Economic Reason_ by Sanders is written by an old friend from college!

* _Basic Economics_ by Sowell looks promising; reco via someone at work.

* _Modern Principles of Economics_ by Cowen + Tabbarok might be good?

* _Cartoon Introduction to Economics_ sounds silly, but was recommended by a
  coworker. (Or, at least, something in this vein was.)

I tried reading some of the _Undercover Economist_ books and was *not* a fan,
despite enjoying Tim Harford as a guest on various podcasts.
