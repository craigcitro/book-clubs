you can take the boy out of doing math research ...

## teaching/learning math

This is mostly a list of books I'm hoping I can read with my kids as the
subject matter strikes their level/fancy.

* _Calculus Simplified_, by Fernandez. [MAA
  Reviews](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/calculus-simplified)
  
* _Electricity and Magnetism for Mathematicians_ by Garrity is by an author I
  like, and is the sort of "guided tour" I tend to enjoy. [MAA
  Reviews](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/electricity-and-magnetism-for-mathematicians-a-guided-path-from-maxwell-s-equations-to-yang-mills)

* _Bicycle or Unicycle?_ by Velleman and Wagon is another enticing problem
  book; I ran into this via the [AMS
  Notices](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202009/rnoti-p1382.pdf) and an
  enjoyable first puzzle.
  
* _The Raven's Hat_, by Peters and Meinshausen seems like a
  possibly-interesting logic puzzle book. [MAA review](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/the-ravens-hat-fallen-pictures-rising-sequences-and-other-mathematical-games)  
  
* _A Topological Picturebook_ by Francis is apparently a visual delight, but
  pricey for what it is.

* _The Math Behind the Magic_ by Behrends is a "math and magic" book; the
  others we've looked at are a little heavy on the math and light on actually
  compelling tricks, but maybe worth a try.

* _Second-year Calculus_ by Bressoud sounds great, especially after reading
  this [post about
  calculus](https://www.mathvalues.org/masterblog/reflections-on-differentials-in-the-first-year-of-calculus)
  by Bressoud. (Obviously not unbiased.) I feel like this should be on the
  list the next time I get a chance to think about differential forms.

More about teaching itself:

* _Making Learning Whole_ by Perkins

Interesting stuff I've read:

* [Knowing and Teaching Elementary
  Mathematics](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202006/rnoti-p842.pdf)
  isn't a huge surprise wrt its conclusions, but I'm curious to know more
  about the studies it references.

Some old-school problem books (h/t Sameer):

* Marin, Problems in Calculus of One Variable
* Irodov, Problems in General Physics 
* Hall, Knight, Higher Algebra
* Lonely, Plane Trigonometry
## assorted

* _Algebraic Geometry: a Problem Solving Approach_ by Garrity is an author I
  enjoy giving a geometrically-motivated tour of alg geo, with problems to
  boot! [MAA
  Reviews](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/algebraic-geometry-a-problem-solving-approach)
  
* _Geometry Revealed_ by Berger is a guided tour of differential geometry, an
  apparently incredible but weighty book (as per the [MAA
  Review](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/geometry-revealed-a-jacobs-ladder-to-modern-higher-geometry)).

* _Numerical Polynomial Algebra_ by Stetter. C'mon, using numerical
  approximation to solve entirely-pure-mathematics problems? That's awesome.

* _Introduction to Representation Theory_, by Etinghof + many others. Short
  and more motivational, with lots of exercises.

* _Geometrical Methods of Mathematical Physics_ is a physicist's intro to
  differential geometry, and has a [strong endorsement by
  Cosma](http://bactra.org/reviews/geometrical-methods/).

* _Invitation to Nonlinear Algebra_ by Michalek and Sturmfels looks like the
  latter half might be a nice set of overview chapters. [MAA
  review](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/invitation-to-nonlinear-algebra)

* ["The Optimality of Bayes'
  Theorem"](https://sinews.siam.org/Details-Page/the-optimality-of-bayes-theorem)
  is something I wish I knew enough information theory (and stats) to
  appreciate.

* _Catastrophe Theory_ by Arnol'd is apparently conversational, and gets
  strong praise from Mazur.

* _Rational Points on Curves over Finite Fields_ by Serre is, well, by Serre,
  so obviously going to be stellar. ([MAA review](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/rational-points-on-curves-over-finite-fields))

### approachable math books

I ran into a nice [math overflow
question](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/31879/are-there-other-nice-math-books-close-to-the-style-of-tristan-needham)
that led to a whole list of books I've wanted to read, along with a few that I
now do:

* _Visual Complex Analysis_ by Needham
* _Visual Differential Geometry and Forms_ by Needham
* _Naive Lie Theory_ by Stillwell
* _Ordinary Differential Equations_ by Arnol'd
* _Indra's Pearls_ by Mumford
* _A Panoramic View of Riemannian Geometry_ by Marcel Berger
* _Shape of Space_ by Jeff Weeks [MAA review](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/the-shape-of-space-0)
* _Symmetry of things_ by John Conway

## gerrymandering

I find this area surprisingly compelling to read about, but I've only dipped
my toe so far.

### read

* Moon Duchin's "Geometry v. Gerrymandering" (in _Best Math Writing 2019_ [MAA
  Review](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/the-best-writing-on-mathematics-2019))
  
* Jordan Ellenberg, "Geometry, Inference, Complexity, and Democracy" (from the
  [Bulletin](https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2021-58-01/S0273-0979-2020-01708-8/S0273-0979-2020-01708-8.pdf))
