## teaching/learning math

This is mostly a list of books I'm hoping I can read with my kids as the
subject matter strikes their level/fancy.

* _Calculus Simplified_, by Fernandez. [MAA
  Reviews](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/calculus-simplified)
  
* _Electricity and Magnetism for Mathematicians_ by Garrity is by an author I
  like, and is the sort of "guided tour" I tend to enjoy. [MAA
  Reviews](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/electricity-and-magnetism-for-mathematicians-a-guided-path-from-maxwell-s-equations-to-yang-mills)

* _Bicycle or Unicycle?_ by Velleman and Wagon is another enticing problem
  book; I ran into this via the [AMS
  Notices](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202009/rnoti-p1382.pdf) and an
  enjoyable first puzzle.
  
* _The Raven's Hat_, by Peters and Meinshausen seems like a
  possibly-interesting logic puzzle book. [MAA review](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/the-ravens-hat-fallen-pictures-rising-sequences-and-other-mathematical-games)  
  
* _A Topological Picturebook_ by Francis is apparently a visual delight, but
  pricey for what it is.

* _The Math Behind the Magic_ by Behrends is a "math and magic" book; the
  others we've looked at are a little heavy on the math and light on actually
  compelling tricks, but maybe worth a try.

* _Second-year Calculus_ by Bressoud sounds great, especially after reading
  this [post about
  calculus](https://www.mathvalues.org/masterblog/reflections-on-differentials-in-the-first-year-of-calculus)
  by Bressoud. (Obviously not unbiased.) I feel like this should be on the
  list the next time I get a chance to think about differential forms.

More about teaching itself:

* _Making Learning Whole_ by Perkins

Interesting stuff I've read:

* [Knowing and Teaching Elementary
  Mathematics](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202006/rnoti-p842.pdf)
  isn't a huge surprise wrt its conclusions, but I'm curious to know more
  about the studies it references.

Some old-school problem books (h/t Sameer):

* Marin, Problems in Calculus of One Variable
* Irodov, Problems in General Physics 
* Hall, Knight, Higher Algebra
* Lonely, Plane Trigonometry
## assorted

* _Algebraic Geometry: a Problem Solving Approach_ by Garrity is an author I
  enjoy giving a geometrically-motivated tour of alg geo, with problems to
  boot! [MAA
  Reviews](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/algebraic-geometry-a-problem-solving-approach)
  
* _Geometry Revealed_ by Berger is a guided tour of differential geometry, an
  apparently incredible but weighty book (as per the [MAA
  Review](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/geometry-revealed-a-jacobs-ladder-to-modern-higher-geometry)).

* _Numerical Polynomial Algebra_ by Stetter. C'mon, using numerical
  approximation to solve entirely-pure-mathematics problems? That's awesome.

* _Introduction to Representation Theory_, by Etinghof + many others. Short
  and more motivational, with lots of exercises.

* _Geometrical Methods of Mathematical Physics_ is a physicist's intro to
  differential geometry, and has a [strong endorsement by
  Cosma](http://bactra.org/reviews/geometrical-methods/).

* _Invitation to Nonlinear Algebra_ by Michalek and Sturmfels looks like the
  latter half might be a nice set of overview chapters. [MAA
  review](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/invitation-to-nonlinear-algebra)

* ["The Optimality of Bayes'
  Theorem"](https://sinews.siam.org/Details-Page/the-optimality-of-bayes-theorem)
  is something I wish I knew enough information theory (and stats) to
  appreciate.

* _Catastrophe Theory_ by Arnol'd is apparently conversational, and gets
  strong praise from Mazur.

* _Rational Points on Curves over Finite Fields_ by Serre is, well, by Serre,
  so obviously going to be stellar. ([MAA review](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/rational-points-on-curves-over-finite-fields))

### approachable math books

I ran into a nice [math overflow
question](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/31879/are-there-other-nice-math-books-close-to-the-style-of-tristan-needham)
that led to a whole list of books I've wanted to read, along with a few that I
now do:

* _Visual Complex Analysis_ by Needham
* _Visual Differential Geometry and Forms_ by Needham
* _Naive Lie Theory_ by Stillwell
* _Ordinary Differential Equations_ by Arnol'd
* _Indra's Pearls_ by Mumford
* _A Panoramic View of Riemannian Geometry_ by Marcel Berger
* _Shape of Space_ by Jeff Weeks [MAA review](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/the-shape-of-space-0)
* _Symmetry of things_ by John Conway

## gerrymandering

I find this area surprisingly compelling to read about, but I've only dipped
my toe so far.

### read

* Moon Duchin's "Geometry v. Gerrymandering" (in _Best Math Writing 2019_ [MAA
  Review](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/the-best-writing-on-mathematics-2019))
  
* Jordan Ellenberg, "Geometry, Inference, Complexity, and Democracy" (from the
  [Bulletin](https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2021-58-01/S0273-0979-2020-01708-8/S0273-0979-2020-01708-8.pdf))

* Moon Duchin on Fair Voting and Random Walks, on the [Joy of
  $x$](https://www.quantamagazine.org/moon-duchin-on-fair-voting-and-random-walks-20200407/)
  podcast.


## Randomized approaches

I first ran into randomized algorithms in William's modular forms book; it was
one of those moments when I realized there's a whole approach to some kinds of
problem that I'd been missing out on.

* _The Probabilistic Method_, by Alon and Spencer. This is apparently a
  classic -- I ended up picking up a copy [spurred by a Twitter
  thread](https://twitter.com/craigcitro/status/1333972568273944582), but
  haven't had a chance to read this yet. The book is about using probabilistic
  proofs to prove existence theorems, which are interesting and surprisingly
  powerful in their own right. 
  
  However, as they point out in the opening section, a probabilistic proof is
  also often a template for a randomized algorithm to produce examples of the
  object you're trying to find. (!!)
  
  [MAA Reviews](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/the-probabilistic-method-0)

* _Probability and Computing_ by Mitzenmacher and Upfal. I ran into this book
  on [Dan Luu's programming list](https://danluu.com/programming-books/), and
  later ran into the [MAA
  Review](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/probability-and-computing-randomized-algorithms-and-probabilistic-analysis).
  
## Pop math

* _Closing the Gap_ by Neale is about the recent work on twin primes.
* _Elliptic Tales_ by Ash + Gross is about elliptic curves.
* _Fearless Symmetry_ by Ash + Gross tries to motivate reciprocity laws for a
  popular audience. (Words I never thought I'd hear.)
* _Genius at Play_ by Roberts is a John H Conway bio. 'Nuff said.
* _Mathematics for Human Flourishing_ by Francis Su -- I read an essay-length
  version of this that I enjoyed; I'm curious what all he has to say in a
  book-length version. (I worry that it's "the same thing, many times".)

## Formalization of mathematics

This is one of those topics I'd happily throw myself into if I were still a
grad student, so maybe it's safer that it's picking up steam now. :)

* Peter's Scholze's [Liquid Tensor
  Experiment](https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2020/12/05/liquid-tensor-experiment/)
  post is trying to drum up support for the formalization community to help
  him formalize and verify a result he's actively working on; that'd be quite
  the endorsement if it works out. 
  
  There are a number of amazing tidbits in there (as noted in [this HN
  thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25324707)); this paragraph in
  particular is incredible:
  
      I have occasionally been able to be very persuasive even with wrong
      arguments. (Fun fact: In the selection exams for the international math
      olympiad, twice I got full points for a wrong solution. Later, I once
      had a full proof of the weight-monodromy conjecture that passed the
      judgment of some top mathematicians, but then it turned out to contain a
      fatal mistake.)
